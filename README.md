## IMPORTANT NOTE:
This is the default and recommended `PROJECTION` branch. Please use it unless you otherwise require legacy (`MASTER` branch) or the absolute newest features (`DEV` branch).

OceanMesh2D is a set of user-friendly MATLAB functions to generate two-dimensional (2D) unstructured meshes for coastal ocean circulation problems. These meshes are based on a variety of feature driven geometric and bathymetric mesh size functions, which are generated according to user-defined parameters. Mesh generation is achieved through a force-balance algorithm combined with a number of topological improvement strategies aimed at improving the worst case triangle quality. The software embeds the mesh generation process into an object-orientated framework that contains pre- and post-processing workflows, which makes mesh generation flexible, reproducible, and script-able.

Getting help

Before creating the pull request, make sure that the examples pass...

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:
- Write minimal working [examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20a%20minimal%20working,to%20be%20demonstrated%20and%20reproduced) that demonstrate the functionality.
- Write good commit and pull request messages.

Code framework
================
`OceanMesh2D`  consists of four standalone classes that are called in sequence. It requires no paid toolboxes to build meshes and has been tested to work with a trial version of MATLAB.

    OceanMesh2D::
    ├── geodata -- process geospatial data.
    ├── edgefx  -- build mesh size functions.
    ├── meshgen -- generate mesh based on mesh size functions and boundaries.
    └── msh     -- store, write, read, inspect, and visualize meshes and their axuillary components for numerical simulation.

Starting Out
============

Clone or download and unzip the current [repository](https://github.com/CHLNDDEV/OceanMesh2D/archive/Projection.zip)

PLEASE READ THE USER GUIDE!
A recent pdf of the user guide is located in this branch. For a continually updated version click [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/hsqjhvtbkgvj#/54715995/) (wait for compilation and then click download PDF)

Run the "setup.sh" bash script to download the required m_map package and the base datasets:
- GSHHG global shoreline
- SRTM15_PLUS global topobathy DEM

Additional data required for some of the following examples must be downloaded manually from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LeQJFKaVCM2K59pKO9jDcB02yjTmJPmL). Specifically, Examples 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5b require additional datasets from the google drive folder while base datasets are sufficient for the other examples.

Testing
==========

To ensure the software is fully functional on your system before building some crazy meshes it is strongly recommended to run the tests (RunTests.m) in the Tests/ directory.

We test all pull requests using this test suite on a local host before accepting. For substantial pull requests we will also test the Examples from the Examples/ directory.

- Correctly deleting weirs from boundary object through `make_bc` delete method. See https://github.com/CHLNDDEV/OceanMesh2D/pull/205

### [4.0.0] - 2021-03-14
## Added
- `mesh2d` interface improvements to filter small polygons.
- Support for creation of `fort.20` files for forcing rivers by @Jiangchao3
- Mesh "cleaning" modes moderate and aggressive transfer nodal attributes via improvements to `msh.map_mesh_properties`

## Changed
- `msh.plot()` overhaul. All options specified via kwarg.
- `msh.plot()` option `subset` option is now called `subdomain`
- `msh.plot()` arbitary f13 option now utilizes `colormap` kwarg
- `utilities/extract_subdomain` now is called with kwargs.
- Cleaning up `msh.bound_courant_number()` to use `msh.get_boundary_of_mesh()` for Delaunay-triangulation and allowing `msh.clean()` to do the transfer of attributes automatically.
- `msh.plus(obj1,obj2)` can now carry over obj2 f13 attributes if also exist in obj1
- `msh()` more efficient storing of boundary conditions read in from fort.xx files, and `msh.write()` can write out arbitrary vertex indices (instead of just 1 to NP).

  made them required to have a 3d shapefiles.

- Ability to use the TPXO9 Atlas for the tidal bcs and sponge (inside tidal_data_to_ob.m and Calc_Sponge.m) by using '**' wildcards in place of the constituent name within the tidal atlas filename (the atlas has an individual file for each constituent).
- Introducing 'auto_outer' option for the make_bc msh method which populates the bc for the outermost mesh boundary polygon (ignores islands)
- Changelog to README
- "mapMeshProperties" msh method ports over mesh properties for a mesh subset
- 'invert' option in the msh.interp method to turn off the DEM value inversion typically performed

## Changed
