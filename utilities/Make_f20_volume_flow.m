% Input a msh class object to get the values of the nodal fluxes (q) (m^2/s) for 
% times between ts and te based on the input file. filename is the name of a column
% delimited csv file that stores the total volume flow (Q) (m^3/s) time series of a 
% cross-section where the riverine boundary located. 
%
% ts and te represent the start and end time of the total volume flow, respectively.
%
% The column of the csv file should be organized as followed:  
% year,month,day,hour,minute,second,volume_flow_1,volume_flow_2... 
% The column order of the total volume flow (volume_flow_1,volume_flow_2...) 
% must be specified in which the riverine boundaries appear in the fort.14 file, or 
% in which you make the riverine boundaries with the data cursor method.  
%
% A description lof transforming the volume flux (m^3/s) to areal flux (m^2/s):
%
% The function of Riverflux_distribution (has been placed in the utilities folder)  
% will be called first to calculate the representative edge width and flux percentage  
% for each node on the riverine boundary. Nodal flux (m^3/s) can be calculated by
% multiplying the total volume flow (Q) (m^3/s) by the percentage of flow dedicated to 
% that boundary node. Then the nodal flux (q) (m^2/s) can be calculate by dividing 
% nodal flux by the nodal edge width.
%
% Note: the default total volume flow (Q) (m^3/s) is an hourly average time series, 
% thus the DT equals to 3600. If your Q is an daily average time series, you should 
% use a value of 86400(24*3600) for DT.
