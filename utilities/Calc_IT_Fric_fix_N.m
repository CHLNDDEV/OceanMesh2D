%  Title:       Calc_IT_Fric_fix_N                                 %
%  Description: The IT calculation process sometimes gets stuck    % 
%               in an infinite loop when using the original N data.%
%               This function is used to fill NaNs in the          %
%               originally generated N data in the vertical        %
%               direction by extrapolating all N values down the   %
%               column using the nearest non-NaN value above       %
%  Inputs:      Original Gridded_N_values.mat dataset              %            
%               (which is generated using Make_Gridded_N.m)        %     
%  Outputs:     An updated .mat file of profiles of N at each      %
%               desired contour level as specified at various      %
%               locations as the original Gridded_N_values.mat     %
